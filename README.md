# Join4Join translations
The public repository for Join4Join translations
# Contributing
If you wish to help translate Join4Join, please firstly ensure you meet the following criteria:
- You are a fluent speaker of the language you are translating to
- You know how to use Join4Join (important so that you know what each bit of text will be used for)
- You are fluent in English 
- You do not have to use google translate (or any other translation software to assist you)
# Steps
To contribute please follow this guide:
- Fork this repository (at https://github.com/join4join/translations/fork) so you have a private copy
- If you are adding a new language, copy + paste English.json in to a new file called `<The name of the language you're translating to, in your language>.json`.
- If you are editing a already existing language just edit the file then commit your changes
- Change the translations on the right of the key, e.g. `"description": "Join4Join is the best website to get members for your discord server! Farm coins and buy members."`, you would edit the text on the right hand side in quotation marks, description needs to stay as it is the key.
- Make sure you keep the capitalisation the same (e.g. if a word is in all capitals, in the translations, keep it in all capitals)
- If there is text inside %% DO NOT CHANGE IT! This is where messages from the website are placed.
- Finally, you can open a pull request from your fork and it will be reviewed, thanks for wanting to contribute!
